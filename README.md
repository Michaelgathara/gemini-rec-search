## How to run
### Prerequisites

* [node + npm](https://nodejs.org/) 
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)

### Gemini Nano Setup
- Ensure you have Chrome Canary
- Sign up for the Gemini Nano Early Preview - [here](goo.gle/chrome-ai-dev-preview-join)
    - Learn more [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in)
- Navigate to `chrome://flags` 
- Search for `gemini` and enable all the flags
    - Prompt API for Gemini Nano
    - Summarization API for Gemini Nano
    - Writer API for Gemini Nano
    - Rewriter API for Gemini Nano
- Seach for ` Enables optimization guide on device` and set it to `Enable Bypass...`
- Disable the text safety flags to stop a bug from falsely flagging Gemini Nano content as non-english
    - Navigate to `chrome://flags/#text-safety-classifier`
- Navigate to `chrome://components`
    - Ensure you have `Optimization Guide On Device Model` with a version that is not `0`

Once you have enabled all of these and been given access to the early preview of Gemini Nano, you should be able to utilize an on-device Gemini model to use the extension

### Setup
- Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
    - You may fill out the env file if you'd like to use a local endpoint for testing, otherwise the extension will use our Google Cloud endpoint for Google Searches and your local on-device Gemini Nano model for AI capabilities


- Frontend
```
npm install
```

- Backend
```
make pull up
```

### Build frontend assets

> [!TIP]
> Rebuild the frontend everytime you make changes to the frontend or add a .env file and reload the extension on Chrome

```
npm run build
```

or

```
make build-ext
```

### Create .env file for API calls

The API is hosted on Google Cloud Run (and requires no extra setup), but only temporarily for testing purposes. If you want to host it locally, create an `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```env
API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is used for Google Search, All Gemini calls are utilizing Gemini Nano

### Load extension to chrome
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and enable developer mode
- Load `dist` directory
- Reload the extension on `chrome://extensions` whenever you rebuild the frontend

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If the extension does not showcase any recommendations, there is a chance that Gemini Nano is not loading properly. 
    - Copy the following into your chrome canary console
    ```
    await ai.summarizer.create();
    await ai.languageModel.create();
    ```
    - This loads up the models needed

- If no recommendations are found and the earlier tip does not work. Try to use a local docker enabled backend for the backend
    - In the .env file you created earlier, uncomment the endpoint and `make up` and `make build-ext` again

## Usage Tips
- Click the extension icon to toggle recommendations on/off
- Click the star to get webpage summaries
- Click any recommendation to open in a new tab
- Use the options menu to customize domains and other settings
